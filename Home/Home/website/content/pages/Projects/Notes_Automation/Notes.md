# Notes_Automation

# What:
A streamlined llm-assisted project notes-> website/product page workflow. 

# Why:
Aiming to prevent re-work, by having my freeform thoughts and research notes automatically utilized and cleaned up into a more polished final product and posted to the web as a project portfolio.

# Goals:
- [ ] Local Obsidian -> Github
	- [ ] Filewatcher to monitor changes and trigger workflows
		- [ ] Use Watchdog library
		- [ ] Have timer to wait for no changes in X seconds before triggering workflow
    - [ ] Copy notes to repo
	    - [ ] TODO: Diff between local notes and repo files?
    - [ ] Create new commit
    - [ ] Add Commit Message
        - [ ] Summarize changes
- [ ] Github Repo -> GH Pages
    - [ ] Only post based on frontmatter metadata
    - [ ] Have "working" and "final" draft settings as well
- [ ] GH Pages -> Custom domain
