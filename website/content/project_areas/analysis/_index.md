### Test title
Lets see how this sucker works
- Hopefully we have content

1. Then we need links [MiraGram]({{< ref "Projects/MiraGram/Notes" >}})
2. Then images?
	1. {{< figure src="https://www.bullishdesign.co/images/programming-1.png" caption="Hugo_Range" >}}

Aaaaaaand that should be it.

## Code Block Test:
```css
.figure {
	display: inline-block;
	line-height: 1
}
```
