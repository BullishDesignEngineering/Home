# Patent Analysis

# What:
A python library to parse and analyze the historical USPTO database. 



# Why:
Use to find interesting patents:
- The "most referenced" patent of the day/week that is just coming off patent. 
- The least referenced patent of the week
- The most ridiculous patent of the week

Use those to create new "inventions"/products utilizing those patents. 
- Need a highly streamlined product development workflow to accomplish. Aim to make this a weekly (and then eventually daily) thing, with full CAD/drawings/BOMs/Website/Social Media presence.
