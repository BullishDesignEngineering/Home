# About
Using Devenv.sh to set up python development environments. 

## Questions:
- How to set up different starting templates from the "devenv init" command?


## Plan:
- Create devenv fork
	- Initialize locally so it's a local project (with obsidian notes for gameplan)
- Update template in that fork
- Create shell script for initialization
- Keep track of further updates in that fork.
